Some information (like my address and phone number) has been removed from this version of my resume. This is because 
    it is so easily accessible to anyone. To view my full, formatted resume, email me.

Below is a link to my HackerRank profile. HackerRank is a free service which allows people to practice their programming
    skills by solving challenges and competing against each other. On my profile you can see the challenges I have completed 
    the "badges" I have received. Please note that I have only had this profile for a short period, so its collection of data
    on my skills remains somewhat limited. For instance, it thinks that I'm not particularly skilled at Python. This is 
    because to date I have only completed one challenge in Python on the site. I have used Python outside of the site many times. This same thing is true for many of the languages listed on my resume.
